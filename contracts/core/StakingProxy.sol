/**
 * @title Staking Proxy
 * @notice Enables a staker to deposit tokens and earn rewards without ever directly interacting with the LST contracts
 * @dev When tokens are queued for deposit, the corresponding liquid staking tokens will be distributed using a merkle
 * tree. The tree is updated once a certain threshold of LSTs is reached at which point LSTs can be claimed. In order
 * for this contract to claim its LSTs (and execute some other funcion calls), merkle data must be passed as an argument.
 * This data is stored on IPFS at the hash which can be queried from this contract. For some functions, this data can be
 * used as is but for ones that require a merkle proof, a merkle tree must be generated using the IPFS data, then a merkle
 * proof generated using the tree.
 * @dev Data may or may not need to be passed when depositing and/or withdrawing depending on the underlying LST implementation.
 * If data does need to be passed, it will need to be fetched from an external source specific to that LST.
